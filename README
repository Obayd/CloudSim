1. CloudSim
--------

CloudSim is a simulator for a Cloud infrastructure (surprise!) developed on top of the SimPy framework.
It's main purpose for now, is to simulate a Scheduler for a cloud, but this can easily be extended to more
complicated functionalities.


2. Requirements
------------

1. Python >= 2.5
2. SimPy
3. 50 nodes on a cloud platform of your choice. Just kidding.


3. Tested Platforms
-------------------

- Ubuntu 10.04 ~x86.


4. Running
----------

$: python CloudSim.py --input <input-file> --conf <conf-file>


5. Working
----------

The basic organisation of the cloud infrastructure comprises of:

1) Task Generators
2) A scheduler
3) Machines for job execution

Inputs are read from the input file, and task generators feed jobs from these tasks
into the scheduler. The scheduler, based on the scheduling algorithm being used,
assigns these jobs to different machines from the cloud infratsructure. It may
also start new machines, stop existing ones, or hold back jobs. The below diagram
depicts the overall structure.

TaskGenerator 1 -----------
                          V       SubmitJobsForExecution
TaskGenerator 2 -----> Scheduler --------------------------> Machine 1
     .                    ^                     |
     .                    |                     |----------> Machine 2
TaskGenerator N ----------                      |
                                                 ----------> Machine N
